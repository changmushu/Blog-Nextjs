**Ashton Dumar Norwill Simmonds**(born April 5, 1995), known professionally as **Daniel Caesar**, is a Canadian R&B singer. After independently building a following through the release of two critically acclaimed EPs, *Praise Break* (2014) and *Pilgrim's Paradise* (2015), Caesar released his debut studio album, *Freudian*, in August 2017, which garnered widespread critical acclaim. He released his second studio album, *Case Study 01*, in June 2019.

今早看到了  <u>[NEVER ENOUGH](https://open.spotify.com/album/7ivbFszr1TbVadj89BIy1y?si=vitSiIbtQoCeBIjzTBBFig)</u>  的蓝色封面，遂点了进去，一直循环到现在。

某种直击大脑的力量...

个人觉得最好听是[cool](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Hs4y1m7Q5/?share_source=copy_web&vd_source=fd692ffa05e0a87b7ae1425613d92735)，弱弱的钢琴声...

Try your best to keep composure

Don't give up all of your smiles

Push away and they'll come closer

Ain't been touched in a while



Sometimes

I get too excited, stars behind my eyelids

Sometimes

I'm nodding in agreement, I don't agree they see it



Play it cool

Do a favor just for you

Cool

Be colder just for you



Try your best to calm me down

Don't give them all of yourself

'Cause one day, they won't be around

Can't go to them for help



Sometimes

I see myself five foot four, playing in my room alone

Sometimes

I see myself amusеd in thought, a nigga had no friends at all



Play it cool

Do a favor just for you

Cool

Be colder just for you

又想买黑胶了(然鹅还没有黑胶唱片机)...
